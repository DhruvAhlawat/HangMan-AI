## Hangman AI
Hangman is a game where a word full of blanks is given we have 6 chances to guess the letters that occur in that word. The code here contains a class to make a Hangman game that gives you random blank words and you can provide guesses to it, and it also implements a solver class that automatically predicts which letters are the most likely to be present in the words and tries to win the game.

Also can generate cool probability plots like this to predict which next letter should be guessed depending on the current word and the used up guesses that we had.
