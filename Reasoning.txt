Maybe we can consider some cases that can be done with n-gram analysis.

stuff like

if we have a middle character to guess between 2 characters then we can directly use 3-gram analysis here.
perhaps even afterward we can try to do something.


So an idea can maybe be to use n-gram like this over all the possible
